# AStarAlgorithm

When running the java executable, make sure you pass the following arguments:

1. The name of the galaxy file you want to search through
2. The index (one based) of the star you want to start on
3. The index of the target star (one based)
4. The leap radius from each star. Note: Giving this argument too low a value with result in no path being possible
